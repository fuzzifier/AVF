This repository hosts implementations of two novel fuzzy clustering algorithms: L1-Regularized Fuzzy c-Means with an Adaptive Vectorized Fuzzifier (AVFL1) and L0-Regularized Fuzzy c-Means with an Adaptive Vectorized Fuzzifier (AVFL0). The Datasets folder contains real experimental data, while Clustering metrics provides evaluation tools.
